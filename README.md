`<flip-clock>` is an element that shows a rotating clock of the current timezone as defined by your system (or at least, as passed to the browser).

## As easy as HTML

<section class="columns">
  <div>

`<flip-clock>` is just an HTML element. You can it anywhere you can use HTML!

```html
<flip-clock></flip-clock>
```

  </div>
  <div>

<flip-clock></flip-clock>

  </div>
</section>

## Lit Component

This component was developed as Lit Web Component, which theoretically can be used by any front-end framework. I have not tested anything beyond the basic HTML element.
